# Simplified Tower of Hanoi in C++

This project showcases a simplified version of the Tower of Hanoi problem solved using C++. The implementation includes custom implementations of linked lists and stacks data structures without relying on external libraries.

## Overview

The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle that involves moving disks from one peg to another following specific rules. This project offers a simplified representation of the problem and demonstrates the solution using C++. Additionally, it leverages custom implementations of linked lists and stacks for efficient disk management and movement.

## Key Features

- **Tower of Hanoi Solver**: Provides a solution to the Tower of Hanoi problem with a simplified representation.
- **Custom Data Structures**: Utilizes custom implementations of linked lists and stacks for disk management and movement.
